# MWA Homework 02 - NodeJS 01
## Written Exercises
1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use `setImmediate` instead of using `setTimeout`? 
2. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate`?
3. Name 10 core modules that Node provides by default, and 10 of the Global objects?

## Exercise 02
Write a function in Node `factorial(n)` to find asynchronously the factorial of a number. Write your observation (CPU, RAM.. etc) on what happens in `Node Process` when we calculate the factorial of a large number.  
* factorial(3) is 3 * factorial(2)
* factorial(2) is 2 * factorial(1)
* factorial(1) is 1 * factorial(0)
* factorial(0) is 1

```javascript
// your Node code here...
console.log('start');
factorial(3).then(console.log); 
console.log('end');

// Test your code in Node.JS CLI, Output:
// start
// end
// 3
```
