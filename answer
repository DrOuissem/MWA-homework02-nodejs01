Exercise 1 : 
1)setImmediate is used to push a task in the poll queue immediately while setTimeout schedules after how many ms the task will be pushed in the Timer queue

2)process.nextTick add a task in the nextTick : the queue with highest priority.
setImmediate is used to push a task in the poll queue which is a macrotask queue

3) Code module : http, url, query string, path, fs, util, assert, buffer, os
Global objects : __filename, __dirname, setTimeout, setInterval, Process, Console

Exercise2: 
async function factorial(a){
    if(a<=1)return 1;
    const a_1 = await factorial(a-1);
    return a*a_1;
}
 
factorial(10).then(console.log)
